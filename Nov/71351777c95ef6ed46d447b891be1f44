In spite of a last-minute reconciliation with the family of late Prince Abubakar Audu, APC stalwarts received a shocking rebuff by the Prince’s son at the grand finale of the governorship election campaign in Lokoja last week. At the Lokoja rally attended by First Lady Aisha Buhari, the party chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and a number of governors, Muhammed Audu, was invited to make a speech to endorse the governor and seal the peace pact. Sources told Interview Confidential that when Muhammed was called upon he was visible shocked and upset. “He pretended that he did not hear his name,” said one source. “When someone tapped him, he shrugged it off, saying no one told him beforehand that he was going to make a speech at the rally.” Another source said Muhammed still wanted to see how Governor Yahaya Bello would reciprocate the peace accord, before “jumping on the bandwagon.”
