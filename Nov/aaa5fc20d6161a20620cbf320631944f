The presidential candidate of Young Progressive Party, YPP, in the 2019 general elections, Kingsley Moghalu, on Wednessday condemned the proposed death by hanging penalty against hate speech by the senate. The Senate on Tuesday reintroduced a bill that seeks to punish persons found guilty of spreading falsehood that led to the death of another person. Reacting to the bill in a tweet,  Moghalu said it was shocking that a bill proposing death by hanging for anyone guilty of hate speech could be  mooted in democratic clime. “It’s shocking that the proposed “death by hanging” bill against hate speech can even be mooted in a democracy. The bill deserves to be hanged!, Moghalu Said. The bill which is sponsored by the Deputy Senate Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, prescribes death penalty for anyone found guilty of spreading a falsehood that leads to the death of another person. “A person who uses, publishes, presents, produces, plays, provides, distributes and/or directs the performance of any material, written and/or visual, which is threatening, abusive or insulting or involves the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, commits an offence, if such person intends thereby to stir up ethnic hatred, or having regard to all the circumstances, ethnic hatred is likely to be stirred up against any person or person from such an ethnic group in Nigeria.”, the bill reads in part.
