The SDP governorship candidate in the just concluded election in Kogi State, Natasha Akpoti, has petitioned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), asking the commission to cancel the result of last weekâ€™s election in the state. Akpoti alleged that widespread rigging, intimidation and violence marred the outcome of the election. The Interview Confidential however gathered that petition may contain seeds of its own defeat. For example, we gathered that, one; it was written while the election was still ongoing, and two; it was submitted to INEC on Monday. The law provides that once elections are over, all petitions should be forwarded to the Tribunal, not to INEC.
