The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has distanced itself from the now ‘famous’ plate number, CHIP WHIP’ has been widely circulated in the Nigerian social media platforms. According the FRSC, the said plate number, which has ‘CHIEF’ was wrong spelled as ‘CHIP’ did not originate from any of the FRSC Number Plate production centres, neither was it issued by the Corps. The Corps Public Education Officer, Mr. Bisi Kazeem, in a statement said that the FRSC, with its International Quality Management certification (ISO 9001: 2008), had rigorous quality procedures for producing and issuing any of its security documents which makes the possibility of such obvious grammatical errors on any of its licences impossible. He further noted, “In addition, a careful assessment of the said number plate will reveal that the characters of the dye are not the same with that of the FRSC production plants while the colour of the graphics (Nigeria Map) on the plate is Brown instead of Green that FRSC uses. “Furthermore, all blanking and screen printing for such plates are done at the Gwagwalada production plant to ensure quality, uniformity and standards in line with his quality procedures of the FRSC in all its produced number plates in contrast to this one. So, we can confirm with certainty that this number plate was neither produced nor issued by the FRSC.” He added that the Corps Marshal, Dr.  Boboye Oyeyemi, had ordered the Sector Commander of Kano State to investigate the origin of the purported number plate and also directed  all field commands  across the country be vigilance and clampdown on producers and issuers of fake number plates.
