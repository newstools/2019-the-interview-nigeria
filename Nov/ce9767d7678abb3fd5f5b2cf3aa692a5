World’s football governing body, FIFA, has appointed a former Arsenal Coach, Arsene Wenger, as its new Chief of Global Football Development. FIFA announced Wenger’s appointment on Wednesday in a statement published on its website. The statement said, “Wenger will be chiefly responsible for overseeing and driving the growth and development of the sport for both men and women around the world. “He will also be the leading authority on technical matters, both as a member of the Football and Technical Advisory Panels involved in The IFAB’s review and decision-making process on potential changes to the Laws of the Game, and as chairman of the FIFA Technical Study Group, which has conducted the technical analysis of FIFA tournaments since 1966. “Wenger’s role will include a particular focus on coach education, while he will also offer invaluable contributions to an executive programme – currently in its inception phase – tailored to encourage former professional players to enter management and which will support them through the post-career transition and bridge the gap between managerial and technical positions in football, the statement reads. Wenger, 70, left Arsenal in May 2018, after 22 years in charge, winning three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups.
