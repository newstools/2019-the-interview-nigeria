The wife of Ekiti State governor, Bisi Fayemi, on Friday promised justice to the family of slain Mrs. Salome Acheju Abuh, the Kogi PDP women leader who was killed last week Monday. Abuh was burnt alive in her house at Ochadamu Ward of Ofu local government area of Kogi State after the results of the election was announced. “Rest in peace Mrs. Salome Abuh”, Mrs. Fayemi wrote on her official twitter page, posting a picture of herself signing Mrs. Abuh’s condolence. Also attached to Mrs. Fayemi’s picture was a short note condemning Mrs. Abuh’s gruesome death and calling for justice for Mrs. Abuh. The short note reads: “Dear Madam Salome, rest in peace. What happened to you should not have happened. No human being deserves to be killed for their political believe.  Women of Nigeria are weeping at this injustice. Justice will be done. You will not die in vain.” President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered full investigation into the death of Mrs. Abuh, charging the police to ensure that her killers are all arrested and prosecuted.
