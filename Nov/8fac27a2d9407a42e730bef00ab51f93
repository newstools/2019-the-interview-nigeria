Former world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has announced that he is “coming out of retirement in 2020.” Mayweather, 42, made this announcement on his official Instagram page on Friday, saying he would be working with Dana White. “Coming out of retirement,” Mayweather wrote. Posting an image of himself and UFC boss White in another post, Mayweather said “Dana White and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020.” The former five-weight world champion, who was undefeated in his career with a record of 50-0, hung up his gloves in 2017 after defeating UFC star Conor McGregor in a boxing match in Las Vegas.
