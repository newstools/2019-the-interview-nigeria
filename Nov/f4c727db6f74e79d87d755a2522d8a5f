Former President Olusegun Obasanjo recently held a meeting with stakeholders of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) to review the 2019 elections, but the meeting also gave an insight on what could be an outline of his thoughts about 2023. Sources told Interview Confidential that Obasanjo used the meeting held at the Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta on November 10 to advise his associates about the options facing them. A source at the meeting said the former president told the ADC stakeholders that they had three options before them: 1) to return to their original parties, i.e. APC or PDP 2) to stay in the ADC and nurture the party to growth ahead of the next general elections, or 3) to wait in anticipation of an implosion in the APC. IC gathered that the former president said he had reason to believe that the contest for the presidential ticket would almost certainly tear the APC apart. “Even within the party now, there are different tendencies jostling and competing,” the source said. “The parties are already fracturing along the lines of ACN and CPC, the original legacy parties. But even these legacy parties are no longer what they used to be. Second term governors among them have different ideas and plans for 2023 and one of them from the South West has vowed that the next president will only come from the ranks of governors.”
