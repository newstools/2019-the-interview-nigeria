The Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has promised to inform the President Muhammadu Buhari about alleged job racketeering in government institutions. He also vowed to protect the identity of any whistle blower in this regard. He said this in a tweet on Saturday, while responding to a tweeter user, Ali Amin, who alleged that job racketeering was still going on in the public service under the current President Buhari administration. “@elrufai Sir, I am contacting you because you seem to be the only public official that takes time out to respond to ordinary folks like me. Sir, can you kindly inform @MBuhari to order an investigation into Job racketeering at the federal level? “There are so many reports of people paying millions of naira for jobs and it is worrisome. It is already an open secret. I know this did not begin with this administration, but it seems to be getting worse under it. Please Sir, kindly bring the president’s attention to it, Ali Amin tweeted. Responding to Ali Amin’s tweet, El-rufai said he would draw the president’s attention to allegation of job racketeering once he gets specific details of government ministries, departments and agencies where job racketeering are taking place. “Thanks for the reach-out. I will be happy to draw PMB’s attention to this, but he will ask for specifics – MDAs, officials alleged to be involved, etc. Can you email me any such confidential details via elrufai@kdsg.gov.ng and I will ensure PMB gets it, and you will remain anonymous.
