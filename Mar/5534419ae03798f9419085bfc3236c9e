Not much was known about Idyl  (Daniel Diongoli) until he emerged winner of the 2017 The Voice Nigeria Season 2. Signed to Universal Music Group, Idyl dropped two singles last year and recently released another single featuring South Africa's Rowlene. In a chat with The Interview, the young man from Bayelsa State says music is not the only artistic talent he has... How much has changed for you since you emerged winner at The Voice Nigeria  2017? Since I won The Voice Nigeria in 2017, my life has changed completely. I have had to re-develop myself because I’m still constantly evolving into the artist I want to be. I am grateful to God Almighty and every other person that has supported me. My life has changed tremendously since I won the show. What has the experience been like working with Universal Music Group Nigeria? Universal Music Group Nigeria is more than just a record label to me; they are my family. I feel so comfortable with them. The experience working of with them has been great and amazing. I’ve gotten exposed to so many opportunities both locally and internationally since I started working with them. What inspired your latest single ‘Satisfy You’ ft South African beauty, Rowlene? I was driving to the studio when my manager, Lucas, sent me this instrumental. I was about 10 minutes away from the studio and I just started dancing to it while imagining my lover seated by my side and me serenading her. Rowlene is an amazing vocalist and I wanted to get a female perspective on the love song What elements usually grab your attention in a song? The beat followed by the melody. I also pay attention to the lyrical content of the song and the aura that the song exudes. Is music the only artistic talent you have? Of course not! I’m open to a lot of things. I am an artist. I also love to dress well, so maybe in the nearest future, I may venture into modelling. I’m also looking forward to acting.
