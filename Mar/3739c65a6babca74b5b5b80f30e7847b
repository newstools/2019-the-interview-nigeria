Interview Confidential has learnt that the only reason why stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are trying to save embattled Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, is 2023. There is concern in the party, especially among its South West leaders, that losing a vital vote bank to the opposition now could endanger the party’s chances in four years’ time. Already, APC lost Oyo State, a key South West bellwether, to the PDP both in the presidential and governorship elections. An APC insider said, “Left to the Ogas in Aso Rock, the governor has not done well. You can also see from the sheer number of voters who turned out to vote against him that they don’t want him again. But South West leaders of the party are worried that if Kano is lost to the opposition now, it could spell danger in 2023. So, don’t be surprised that there might be a last-minute rally to save Ganduje.” Gbenga Daniel’s Long Grudge Ends Former Ogun State governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, wanted out long ago. From the moment Senate President Bukola Saraki replaced him as director general of the Atiku Presidential Campaign, Daniel made no secret of his displeasure at being cast aside. Insiders told Interview Confidential that even before the February 23 presidential election, Daniel had sent feelers to the top APC members that he was prepared to switch parties. It therefore came as no surprise when he threw his weight behind APC’s Dapo Abiodun in Ogun State, against his party’s candidate. Yes, Daniel has said he’s quitting politics, but readers are advised to take this announcement with a healthy pinch of salt. Wait and see.
