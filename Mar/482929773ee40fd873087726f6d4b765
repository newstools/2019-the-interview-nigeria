Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, told The Interview that the future is bright for the national team as there are young and promising players in the team: What should Nigerians expect from the game against Seychelles and Egypt, especially after the team already qualified for AFCON? Every game is so important, whether a qualifier or a friendly. All games are important to Nigerians and also to the technical crew because it is going to form part of our preparations for the AFCON. Itâ€™s also important for team bonding. Was that informed the quality of players invited for the game? The quality of players invited reflects the seriousness of the technical crew. Although we still have a few months before the AFCON, the players invited have to showcase their talent, and justify their inclusion in the team. Nigeria has a young and very promising team that will do great exploits for the country. We expect the team to get its acts together and explode in Egypt by going as far as the final The last time Nigeria participated at the AFCON, the Super Eagles won it, can this team repeat that feat in Egypt? Nigeria has a young and very promising team that will do great exploits for the country. We expect the team to get its acts together and explode in Egypt by going as far as the final. What can you say about the goalkeeping department which you are directly supervising? That department is solid, and I am sure they are not going to disappoint Nigerians. They are currently doing well for their clubs, (Ikechukwu) Ezenwa for Katsina United; (Daniel) Akpeyi for Kaizer Chiefs; and (Francis) Uzoho in Cyprus for Anorthosis Famagusta. All we want is for them to come to the national team and replicate their club form. Are you saying there are no other goalkeepers good enough to displace any one of them? We are looking out for other able hands but at this moment, those are the best hands with us and we all have confidence in them and they will do Nigeria proud.
