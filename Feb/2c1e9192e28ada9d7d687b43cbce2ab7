A return voter, Obol Omini, who voted at ECOWAS, Asokoro, gives The Interview a brief account of his experience during Saturday's presidential and National Assembly elections: What was the voting process like for you? I came here at 5 am. Not long afterwards, INEC of officials and presiding officers started coming. That was at about 6 am. And since before then we had already written our names. They followed the numbering and started calling us. The accreditation went very smoothly. The card readers functioned well and there were no incident forms. I voted smoothly and I voted the party of my choice. And I like the organisation of INEC, I am very happy with them. So, do you think it was good INEC postponed the elections? If what I have seen here was what made them to postpone the election, they prepared well and everything is going on smoothly. Did you notice any shortage in election material or any staff that seemed unprepared? No, all the electoral materials were there. The observer teams, the media, the party agents were allowed to see the voting materials and they confirmed everything was okay. This is an improvement on our elections in Nigeria. Did you vote in the last election? Yes, I did. That time, there was incident form. But this, card reader captured everybody.
