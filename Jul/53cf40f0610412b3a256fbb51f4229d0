Congratulations on the team’s qualification to the next round, how do you feel? I’m excited we progressed. We also regret the defeat against Madagascar, but the defeat will turn out to be a blessing for us. This is because it was a strong wake up call for us. We have to brace up and be ready for the next game against Cameroon. Despite having a good game against Burundi, you had to leave the pitch due to injury, were you disappointed? Yes, I was disappointed but that is football. Injury is part of football and as footballers we have to deal with it when it comes. I have started running and gradually making a return, but I will take it slowly and I won’t rush my return. Hopefully, I will get some minutes again in the tournament. How far do you think the Super Eagles can go? We are in Egypt to be African champions; this is the communication among the players. We want to conquer Africa and write our names in the golden book of Nigerian football. We’ll continue to work hard and give it our best. Do you see yourself still playing at the competition? Yes, I’m optimistic. I have started training and within days I will be back to 100 per cent fitness, but I will take it slowly. What has been the relationship among the players, especially in the camp? It’s been an incredible relationship. This squad has been together for years and the new players have also blended. Tell us about your charity organisation and why you started it The Shehu Foundation was set up to give back to the society that produced me.  My society was the reason why I am here today. We look at various challenges in our society and we ensure we solve them. We won’t relent and we’ll continue to assist our society and make it better.
