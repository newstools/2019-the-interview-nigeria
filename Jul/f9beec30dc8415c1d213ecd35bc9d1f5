It has been difficult for the strikers to score goals at this competition, what’s the problem? It’s my job as a striker to score goals but sometimes when you don’t get enough balls it is difficult. If you look at the three games I played, you can count how many through passes I got.  In football when you don’t get enough of the balls, it is difficult to score goals. So what are you as a team doing about this? We have been working hard in training. We have been working on our finishing with the coach. There have been a lot of strategy sessions on movements and transitions; on how the front line can get the passes and I know it is going to be a different thing from our next match. Can you say the injury you had before the AFCON affected your performance? I was out for about two months before I played in the match against Burundi. I was injured for six weeks and it took me sometime time to fully recover for this tournament and that affected a bit of my sharpness. I scored seven goals in eight games for my club before the injury but I am very much okay now. What should Nigerians expect in the next game in the competition after the disappointing 2-0 defeat against Madagascar? The last match was a disappointment, we didn’t play very well. I think we were a bit relaxed, maybe because we had already qualified. I can tell you it would be a different game if we were to meet Madagascar again. I don’t want to give an excuse that we underrated them because they played as if their lives depended on the match. They fought for every ball. It was a wake-up call for us, now there is no room for mistakes; we have to win our matches if we want to continue here in Egypt.
