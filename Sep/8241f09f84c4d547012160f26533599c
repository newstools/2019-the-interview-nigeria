How does it feel adding the African Games title to the Senior African Athletics Championship you won last year in Asaba? Well it’s a thing of joy. It’s something I’ve been working for. Even last year I really worked hard because I wanted to be the champion and after that I told myself that I would need to work harder if I want to be the best. Becoming African champion is not enough; maintaining the status is the main job. After winning last year, I knew people would be waiting for what I will do this year and I am happy to have achieved the title in Morocco. Just last year, you were in Nigeria, but today you are in the US as a foreign-based athlete; how would you compare the two? I will say there are not too many differences between been a home-based athlete and foreign-based athlete. It’s just a thing of joy for me moving to the US to continue with my career and studies. How has it been since you moved to the US? Initially it was stressful and not easy, especially combining classes and trainings. Last year back at home, I was only thinking about my training, how to jump well and perform well in competitions. However, since moving to the US, I have to add classes to my thinking and how to get good grades in my courses. What was your target, coming to Morocco? Coming to Morocco, I was not targeting the title alone, but also to hit the World Championship mark and the Olympic Games standard while also creating a new Games record. But it was unfortunate that I couldn’t make the standard for the two championships. I am happy creating a new Games Record and winning the title, so I will have to take those two as a good compensation. I will continue to work to get the Olympic Games standard.
