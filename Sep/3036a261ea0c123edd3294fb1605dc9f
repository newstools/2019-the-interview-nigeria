It was a mixed feeling moment for you scoring against Togo while your team lost the game 4-1, how do you feel? I felt so bad after the game because we started well but didn’t end well and for my goal, I would happily take a good result in Togo over scoring and losing. Do you think Nigeria can still qualify? I’m very optimistic; we will win the match Insha Allah. If Togo could score four goals against us then we can put five past them when they come to Nigeria. What led to the total capitulation, especially towards the end of the game? I can’t really say what went wrong, but like I said, we already put the defeat behind us and are looking forward to the future. How do you think the team should approach the second leg? We are going to play them like we played Sudan as we will go for early goals so as to kill the game before the Togolese will know what befell them. For now I only think, breathe and eat Nasarawa United, nothing yet but my prayer is to move abroad and then play for the Super Eagles You are part of the team that qualified Nigeria for the U-23 AFCON, how ready are you for the championship? Yes, I am part of the team and I am so so ready for the championship. It is going to be a team effort in Egypt and I want to assure Nigerians that we are going to make them proud. Tell us about your club career? I’m still a bona-fide player of Nasarawa United and nothing has changed for now. At your tender age, what can you say about your career? What more can I say? I’m a product of grace and my story will never be complete without Nasarawa United. I’m still with them and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity given to me to excel. What does the future hold for you? For now I only think, breathe and eat Nasarawa United, nothing yet but my prayer is to move abroad and then play for the Super Eagles.
