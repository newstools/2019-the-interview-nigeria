Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, on Tuesday condemned in strong terms xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. He described the development as a betrayal of the key role Nigeria played to liberate the country from apartheid. According to a statement from the office office of the Vice President, he spoke in Kano during a visit to inaugurate the Energising Education Power Project at Bayero University Kano. Said VP Osinbajo: “Let me say first that these recent attacks are condemnable. It is very sad and very unfortunate that the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians living in South Africa are once again being destroyed with such wantonness and with such carelessness and recklessness. “It is unfortunate because Nigeria and Nigerians invested a great deal in the destruction and the pulling down of apartheid. Besides, these acts of bigotry are entirely contrary to the very ideals that all the great South African leaders including the present President fought for, and for which many gave their lives. “Mr. President has already spoken about this and obviously we are very concerned and certainly intend to take this up with the authorities in South Africa in order to ensure that this sort of thing does not repeat itself. This is absolutely unacceptable and unconscionable.” Iconic Dr. Nelson Mandela emerged the first black president of South Africa in 1994 after spending 27 years in prison in the struggle to end white-only rule.
