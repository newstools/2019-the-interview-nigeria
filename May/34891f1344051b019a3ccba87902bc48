Wale Adenuga Productions is renowned for family entertainment, from Super Stories to the comedy series Pa Ajasco and Family. Much of its success is attributed to its founder and Chairman Wale Adenuga who burst into the limelight over three decades ago with his funny and witty Ikebe Super magazine. Recently, the production company released a blockbuster ‘Knockout’ to critical acclaim. The movie stars regular characters of the production house such as Pa Ajasco, Boy Alinco and Boy Alinco as well as most Nollywood comedy heavyweights like Sola Sobowale, Patience Ozokwor, Chiwetalu Agu, among others. Adenuga describes the new flick as a comeback and his impression of the film industry: ‘Knockout’ seems like a reunion of your past productions. Is it deliberate? It is the essence. It is a big comeback to the movie industry. We want to show the whole world that we are not only for TV productions. We are back to film. We specialize in comedy. We are giving them the best to make them laugh like they have never laughed before. With the big review from the cinemas, are there plans to make CD copies? Maybe after five years. In comedy, you keep showing it more than five times. You can keep it and later show it to a new audience. Each time you show it, it will always make people laugh. There seems to be a lot of famous comedy actors from Nollywood, Instagram and others. What informed that selection? Nigeria is richly blessed in terms of actors. We have abundance of actors in Nigeria. It is one of our strategies for this film. We deliberately used them for various roles and it has really worked for us. We used them in their comfort zones. We tapped their strengths. Each of the artistes was used appropriately. Are you impressed so far with the film industry? Yes, I am impressed. We complement each other. No competition. Some are doing serious drama; some are doing comedies. We are all entertaining.
