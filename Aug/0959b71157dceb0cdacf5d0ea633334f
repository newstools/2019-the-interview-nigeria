How did you feel when the D’Tigress won the Afrobasket, making it a back-to-back victory after winning it two years ago in Mali? It was a big one for the team retaining the title. The outcome was as a result of proper planning and long-term Most of the members of this current team were members of the team that played the Olympic Games qualifiers in 2016 and I can tell you that they are getting better. We need to work and train harder on the free throws and the three pointers because it is true that we didn’t achieve that a lot in the final They defeated the host Senegal in the final, what does this say about the team? Beating Senegal again is a big boost to maintain our rankings in the world; it is a great development for us as a nation. A great feeling and good achievement for the girls but at the same time, this is a job that they started in 2016 and wining the Afrobasket back-to-back shows consistency on the part of the team and also the players. How do you think they can be better? They just have to add one or two things so they could be a better formidable team which will take Nigeria Basketball to greater heights They won but had problems converting some of their free throws, how do we correct this? We need to work and train harder on the free throws and the three pointers because it is true that we didn’t achieve that a lot in the final. But what we missed in that, our athletics; the fight for each ball really covered up for us in the game. However, we need to work on that because if we want to win internationally, we will have to make those free throws and three pointers count in each game. We are fortunate to get away with it against Senegal but we might not be so fortunate against more experienced teams, our energy and defensive principles helped us a lot against Senegal and through the championship..
