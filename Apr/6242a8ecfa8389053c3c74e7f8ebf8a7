There could be a major shake-up at the top of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) anytime now. Authoritative sources told Interview Confidential that the FIRS has been under the X-ray for some time now, adding that, “imminent root-and-branch changes cannot be ruled out at this point.” The Premium Times reported on Monday that nine top FIRS officials had been taken into custody by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of multi-billion fraud. Sources told Interview Confidential that the changes may reach to the very top. The Managing Director of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria and top banker, Mr. Ahmed Kuru, may be among those penciled in for the FIRS. The FIRS Chairman, Mr. Babatunde Fowler, reported recently that revenue on his watch has increased to N5.32trn, an all-time high.
