When should we expect your next album? Next month. It’s three years from your last album. Why the break? I guess I just needed to be ready. I was taking a different direction in terms of creating the album, who to work with and you know I was really waiting to be inspired for my next phase. Last year made it 10 years I started my career. There was a lot of spiritual awakening that took place. There are people who are doing music but have no direction. They are not signed to a label. They don’t have mentors. I started this creative hub to help shape these artistes Recently you tweeted that you chose to sacrifice a lot to be on the path that you are now. Where was that coming from? I have a creative hub for artistes, especially young creatives that are trying to go into the music industry and do not know how to do so. There are people who are doing music but have no direction. They are not signed to a label. They don’t have mentors. I started this creative hub to help shape these artistes. Wasn’t that tasking? It was. That is the story behind the tweet. I sacrificed a lot for the path I chose. One of the things that I figured while I was working on my album was that I was called to be more than just a musician. I was called to help other people find their path but that comes with responsibility.
