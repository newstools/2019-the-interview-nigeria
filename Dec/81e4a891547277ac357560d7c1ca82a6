The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Shehu Sani, former senator representing Kaduna central, according to a report by Cable. Additional information obtained by The Interview from an EFCC source said Sani was arrested on suspicion of collecting $10,000  from a businessman, proprietor of ASD Motors promising to pass it on to Ibrahim Magu, the acting chairman  of the anti-graft agency. We gathered that Sani was on administrative bail but was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after he failed to keep an appointment with EFCC. The Interview could not independently verify this claim, but Cable quoted one Cole Michael, an aide of the former lawmaker, who said it is untrue that Sani was arrested.
