Mr. Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and publicity to the president, has said that the Nigerian government is not answerable to United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Adesina spoke on Channels TV’s Politics Today while answering questions bordering on the re-arrest of Omoyele Sowore at an Abuja High Court last Friday. When asked if the government was not concerned about increasing criticisms at the international level on violation of human rights under the watch of president Buhari, Adesina said the EU, UK and the US should steer clear of Nigeria’s internal issues. He stated, “We are not answerable to the U.S., the UK or the EU. We are Nigeria, a sovereign country. Those countries and entities have issues of their own, let them deal with their issues, while Nigeria deal with her own internal issues. Mr. Adesina also said the government would review its actions only on genuine issues raised and not calls from babel of voices because it would distract the government.
