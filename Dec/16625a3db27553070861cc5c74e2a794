Thugs on Monday disrupted a protest led by Coalition of Civil Societies, demanding the president Muhammadu Buhari-led government obey court order at the National Human Rights commission Headquarters Abuja. Amnesty International, SERAP and other civil groups had organised a protest tagged “freedom rally” held in both Lagos and Abuja. The groups are demanding that the government obey court order and release Omoyele Sowore, Agba Jalingo and other political detainees. The peaceful protest at NHRC Abuja was however disrupted after pro Buhari protesters stormed the venue and chase away protesters, chanting ‘Sai Baba, Sai Buhari’. In a video posted by VOICE TV on twitter, Deji Adeyanju, one of the anti-protesters, was brutalised by hoodlums chanting ‘Sai Baba’, while other protesters scampered away. Adeyanju has been reportedly hospitalised and all attempts by our reporter to reach him failed as he neither picked his calls nor responded to a text message.
