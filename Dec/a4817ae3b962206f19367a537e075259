The publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, has been rearrested by State Security Service less than 24 hours after he was granted bail. Sowore, who was granted bail on Thursday after spending over 120 days in DSS detention, was forcefully rearrested at Abuja Federal high Court on Friday. The reason for his arrest is unknown. Speaking in a video posted on Twitter by Sahara Reporters on Friday, before he was arrested, Sowore said he would not give up on calling for a better Nigeria for all. He said, “What is important that I want Nigerians to know is that I am not going to give up until every Nigerian benefits from the country that is theirs. I have made very clear. They tried to break me in prison.” Sowore, who confirmed a report by Premium Times that revealed that delegations were sent to prevail on him while he was in detention, said  the plot to forcefully rearrest him is part of the DSS plots to kill him. “They sent delegations to me, offering all kinds of things but I refused. And they promise that I will not walk out of their detention alive. That is what they came here to implement today. Nobody in Nigeria should be afraid. It is our country and some persons must make sacrifice for it to become a country of rule and law,” he said.
