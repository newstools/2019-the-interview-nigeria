An Abuja Federal High Court, on Thursday, fined the Department State Services (DSS), the sum of N100,000 for disregarding the November 6 ruling that ordered them to release detained Sahara Reporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore, after meeting bail conditions. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, who presided over the case, also ordered the release of Sowore, and his co-accused, Olawale Bakare, a 21-year old student. Sowore, who was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for planning to lead a protest tagged, #RevolutionNow, has been detained by the DSS despite two court orders to release them after meeting bail conditions. Meanwhile, protesters from Soworeâ€™s hometown stormed the Court while the case was ongoing, carrying placards. Most the protesters, who spoke in Ondo dialect, demanded that Sowore and Bakare be released.
