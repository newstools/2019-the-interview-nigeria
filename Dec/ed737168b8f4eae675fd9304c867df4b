Two of the daughters of former Vice President and presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar will wed this weekend. Sources told Interview Confidential that the Nikkai will take place in Abuja. An inside source said a pre-wedding reception was hosted in Abuja on Wednesday at the residence of the President of the Nigerian courts of appeal, Justice Zainab Adamu Bulkachuwa. In November 2015, Atiku gave out three of his daughters, including Walida, in a wedding which the former vice president announced on Twitter; while in November 2016, another of his daughter’s, Rukaiya, had what was described as a “fairytale wedding” to Aminu Sani Bello, son of Colonel Sani Bello. Atiku returned to the country recently after over five months in Dubai.
