The minister of communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, has said he is one of those opposing resist communications tax because it is not “good for the sector”. The minister made this statement in a short video posted by Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy on twitter. Pantami revealed that he had been approached to champion the communications tax bill as the communications and digital economy minister but that he resisted the idea. He said, “Some Nigerians have been agitating for communications tax. So far, I am among the people that are resisting. I was even advised to be the champion of the bill but I resist. The minister said pushing the bill as an executive bill would aid its quick passage at the National Assembly because the government needs money but he is not convinced that communications tax is good for the sector. “If we are trying to push them to the wall then we can be the one to take the bill to the National Assembly and it will be much easier if it is an executive bill. “Because government needs money. But the problem is the fact that I am not convinced that this is good for the sector and it is my responsibility as the minister to protect the interest of the sector,” Pantami said.
