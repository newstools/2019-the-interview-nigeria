President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday urged Nigerians not to let terrorists divide the country along religious lines. Buhari spoke through his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, in a statement following execution of some Christians and Muslims by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), noted that Boko Haram insurgents were godless and callous gang of murderers, giving Islam a bad through their nefarious activities. He said, “I am profoundly saddened and shocked by the death of innocent hostages in the hands of remorseless, godless, callous gangs of mass murderers that have given Islam a bad name through their atrocities “We should, under no circumstance, let the terrorists divide us by turning Christians against Muslims because these barbaric killers don’t represent Islam and millions of other law-abiding Muslims around the world. “As a President, the collective security of all Nigerians is my major preoccupation and the death of an innocent Christian or Muslim distresses me.’’ The President said the terrorists had no clearly defined agenda except the pursuit of evil through indiscriminate murder of innocent people, contrary to the teachings of Islam, which prohibits massacre.
