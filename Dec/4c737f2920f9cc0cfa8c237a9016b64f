President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Nigerian-born World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua, for defeating Andy Ruiz Jnr to regain his titles on Saturday night in a rematch. Special Adviser to the President On Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, made this known in a statement posted on his Facebook page. “The downfall of a man is truly not the end of his life. There’s always another, and better day. This is a lesson we must all learn from you as a country,” the statement reads. Joshua, who lost the titles to Ruiz in June, bounced back to defeat Ruiz in a 12-round rematch at the Diriyah Arena, Saudi Arabia. By Saturday’s victory, Joshua joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Patterson, great boxers who reclaimed the world heavyweight title in a direct rematch.
