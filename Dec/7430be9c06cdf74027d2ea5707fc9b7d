The Punch Newspaper has said it cannot comment at this time on the release of former NSA, Sambo Dasuki; and the Publisher of Sahara Reporters. The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami in a statement earlier on Tuesday said Dasuki and Sowore were being released and were expected to abide by the bail conditions. Both were held in detention by the State Security Service in defiance of several court orders granting them bail. Dasuki had been in SSS custody since December 2015. Executive Director of PUNCH, Mr. Joseph Adeyeye, who spoke with The Interview said it was not the company’s policy to comment on their stories, editorials and the fallout of such stories or editorials. The Interview asked Adeyeye, after Tuesday’s announcement PUNCH planned to change its decision to call  President Muhammadu Buhari a retired major general and his government a regime. Adeyeye said, “Unfortunately, we cannot comment on any of our stories and editorials or their fallouts. It is the policy of the company not to comment on them. I won’t be able to oblige you with a comment. I also won’t be able to comment on the release of Sowore”. The Punch, following the rearrest of Sowore earlier this month, in a strong worded editorial on December 11, 2019 came down hard on the Buhari government comparing his disregard for the rule of and disobedience of court orders to his time as a military head of state in the mid 1980s. In protest, the paper vowed to prefix Buhari’s name with Major General, his rank as a military dictator in the 80s and label his present government as a regime “until the purge themselves of their insufferable contempt for the rule of law”.
