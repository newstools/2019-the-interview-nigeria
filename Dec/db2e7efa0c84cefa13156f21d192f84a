The Managing Director of Maersk Nigeria, a major shipping company, Mr. Gildas Tohouo Tohouo, was attacked last night in his home last night and reports said his wife may have been killed in the attack. Sources told The Interview that Mr. Tohouo was attacked at night in his Lugard Avenue home, Ikoyi, Lagos by persons who posed as electricians. We gathered that he was stabbed and left for dead, while his wife was forced to drink a deadly substance before the attackers fled the scene. Tohouo, a Camerounian, married to a Bulgarian, has been taken to an undisclosed hospital. Reports are still unclear how the attackers gained entry into the apartment of the Tohouos’ or the motive for the attack. At press time, sources said the three young children of the Tohouos’ were unharmed. The Police Public Relations Officer of the Lagos Police Command, Mr. Elkanah Bala said he was not aware of the attack at the time of our first call at 1.56pm. He asked us to call back in 30 minutes. However, when he was called back almost an hour later, he didn’t pick his call.
