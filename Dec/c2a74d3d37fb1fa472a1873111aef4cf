A court in Saudi Arabia had sentenced five men to death and three to prison terms over the killing of the Saudi dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last year, the kingdom’s public prosecutor’s office said on Monday, according to a report by New York Times. The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi media figure and columnist for The Washington Post, brought international outrage and battered the reputation of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain paperwork he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée. Inside, he was confronted by Saudi agents, who killed him and dismembered his body. His remains have yet to be found. The trial was held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The kingdom never announced the suspects’ names, and foreign diplomats who attended sessions of the trial were sworn to secrecy. It was not immediately clear when the final trial session was held.
