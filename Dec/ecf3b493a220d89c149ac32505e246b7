Bismarck Rewane, a member of the Economic Advisory Council (ECA), has said that federal government’s obedience to court orders will boost investors’ confidence. Rewane, said this on Wednesday during an interview on Channels Television’s Business Morning. Following the release of the convener of the RevolutionNow protest, Mr Omoyele Sowore and a former National Security Adviser, Mr. Sambo Dasuki by the State Security Service (SSS), Rewane said investors would have more confidence when a government is liberal, tolerant and obey court orders. He said, “The more liberal, the more tolerant the government is, the more confidence investors will have. It is not the release of people, it’s the obeying of court orders. “If for example, I take the government to court because my tax liability is higher and the court says go and refund and the court refuses, those are the things investors are looking at. Rewane said government must be a good example of obedience to rule of law because government set the law. He stated, “If there is a dispute, they need remedies. The government has to be a good example of obedience to the rule of law because they set the law. This move now shows that the government is law-abiding.”
