Former Governor of Ogun State and now Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District, Ibikunle Amosun, is mounting in influence. His rise is sending tongues wagging about whether Abuja is building an alternative power base in the South West to spite Bourdillon (the Ikoyi-Lagos residence of the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu). A trending message on WhatsApp, captures recent gains of Amosun as follows: 1). Former Special Adviser to Amosun on Rural Development, Adewale Ogunyomade, now member of the FIRS Board (where Lagos-boy, Tunde Fowler has just been removed). 2). Former Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure under Amosun, Olamilekan Adegbite, was named Minister of Mines and Steel Development, instead of a nominee of VP Osinbajo 3). Amosun’s former Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Adeleke Adewolu, appointed Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Engagement at the Nigerian Communications Commission 4). Amosun’s former Commissioner for Agriculture and Urban and Physical Planning, Mrs. Ronke Sokefun, got Chairmanship of the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation, at the expense of Bode Mustapha, who had been screened by the Senate 5). Current Postmaster-General/CEO of the Postal Services, Bisi Adegbuyi, is a product of the Amosun camp. Who’s next…watch out!
