The Senator representing New Jersey, Cory Booker, has called on the Nigerian government to ensure the safety of Omoyele Sowore as he awaits trial. Booker, who was among six US lawmakers that wrote Abubakar Malami, demanding that the Sowore be released from detention in line with the rule of law, made this statement on twitter. Nigerian government bowed to pressure, releasing former National Security Adviser (NSA) Sambo Dasuki and convener of online #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore from detention on Tuesday. Reacting to the release of Sowore from detention on Tuesday, Booker said releasing Sowore was a good development. He said, “Glad to hear that Omoyele Sowore has been released from prison, though it’s unfortunate he can’t join his family in NJ for the holidays.” Booker called on Nigerian government to ensure security and safety of Sowore and also urged the government to cease attack on the press. He said, “Now, the Nigerian government must assure his continued safety and security as he awaits his trial and cease their concerning attacks on the press.”
