The Department of State Services finally caved in to pressure on Thursday evening and released the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore and his co-accused, 21-year-old Olawale Bakare, after they had spent 125 days in detention. Their release this evening is coming in less than 24 hours after an Abuja Federal High Court not only ordered  the DSS to release Sowore and Olawale within 24 hours but also fined them (DSS),  the sum of N100,000 for disregarding the November 6 ruling that ordered them to release the detainees after meeting bail conditions. Sowore, was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for planning to lead a protest tagged, #RevolutionNow, and subsequently detained by the DSS despite two court orders to release them after meeting bail conditions. The DSS had instead continued to play a cat and mouse game with his lawyers, and claiming at a point that they could not release him because there was no competent surety they would hand him over to. Earlier this week a video was released of his aged mother where she pleaded with President Buhari to release her son, insisting that he was not a criminal.
