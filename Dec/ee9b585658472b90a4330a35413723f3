Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has alleged that Ekiosa Market was burnt by those who want to embarrass his government. The Ekiosa Market, one of the most popular in Benin City, went up in flames on Sunday and causing traders to lose millions of naira. Speaking to traders in a video released on Facebook, Obaseki said the Ekiosa fire outbreak was not an accident but the work people who want to embarrass his government. Obaseki who spoke in Pidgin said, “This fire wey una see, nor be accident. Na pipo na dem put am. And dem get reason why dem put am. Dem say them wan shame us. Dem don try other things and una know dem nor succeed. Dem say before Christmas dem go dey go do so many things so that pipo wey dey Benin no go happy with government.” He assured the traders that his government would compensate them for their loss and directed that they give him a list of all the traders with shops in the market, adding that the government would release N100m to compensate them.
