The Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has urged Christians to delete the Netflix App and unfollow Netflix. The cleric sent out a tweet on Sunday, in which he not only condemned Netflix but also called on true Christians to delete Netflix and unfollow it for premiering the movie, “Gay Jesus.” Netflix is a streaming service that allows its members to watch a wide range of TV shows, movies, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices. He said, “Delete Netflix app on your system, unfollow them if you are a true Christian.” Suleman said the movie Gay Jesus was an insult to Christianity and an abuse on sensibilities of Christians, saying Christians should condemn it. He tweeted, “The movie ‘Gay Jesus’ is an insult to christianity and abuse to our sensibilities.we stand to condemn it and all it stands for…Mad people.”
