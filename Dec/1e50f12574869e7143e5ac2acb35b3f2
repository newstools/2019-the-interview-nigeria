Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has decried the current debate among Nigerian Christians over Christmas. Adeyemi, who shared his opinion on his twitter page on Friday, noted that countries that brought Christianity to Nigeria are celebrating Christmas with uninterrupted power supply, while Nigerians are still quarrelling on whether eating Christmas chicken will make one go to heaven or hell. He said, “The countries from where they brought Christianity to Nigeria celebrated Christmas with uninterrupted power supply. “Some of us were quarelling over whether eating Christmas chicken will make us go to heaven or not. Sense will “fall on us” one day. I pray it won’t be long. Adeyemi wondered why Nigerians were not debating the fact that Nigeria has hardly added 2000 MW in 20 years despite spending more money on power than Egypt. He said, “I heard @AlikoDangote say that Egypt added 10,000 MW of electricity generation in 18 months.
