Former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, has said that he doesn’t have anything to say to the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government for keeping him locked up for four years. Dasuki, who spoke in an interview with Voice Of America, Hausa, on Wednesday also noted that he had no feud with President Muhammadu Buhari who ordered his incarceration for four years despite meeting bail conditions. Dasuki, who was arrested in December 2015, attributed his arbitrary detention to the work of God. He said, “There is nothing really to say to the government. Everything that happens to an individual is from God. It is only God’s will that will prevail. It is ignorance or lack of faith that pushes some to think that certain individuals are behind their predicaments. “Everything is ordained by God. Like you said, I was detained for four years and I am out today. Only God knows tomorrow. The only thing is that there must be fairness. Whoever goes to the Mosque on Friday must surely have heard the Imam always preach for fairness and honesty. There is a reason for that. Everyone should listen to it.” Dasuki thanked Nigerians who kept calling for his release and said he is healthy and now ready to defend himself in the court. He said, “Of course, I stopped going to the court because I was granted bail but the government refused to release me and I said whenever the bail order is complied with I will appear before the court and defend myself. I am ready.” Credit: Premium Times
